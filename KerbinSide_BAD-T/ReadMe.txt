This pack comes with three premade arenas for 2v2 dogfights. Each arena features 4 runways, divided into A and B groups for easy setup of craft.

Boostershire farms: 
Small farm next to a river. Runways are closer together; attempting to do 2v2 with bomber-sized craft may result in runway collisions during takeoff.
Runway Length; 450m
takeoff orientation:
	A -->
	A -->
	<-- B
	<-- B

Messerkerman Aircraft Factory: 
Factory complex build adjacent to a scenic Alpine lake. Beautiful view. Short runway length mitigated by runway placement.

tankeoff orientation:
	A -->
	A -->
	<-- B

Runway length: 825m
Takeoff orientation:
	A -->        <-- B
	A -->        <-- B    

This pack also comes with one premade arena for 1v1 or 2v2 dogfights. This arena features 2 runways, divided into A and B for easy setup of craft.

Crater Fleet Carrier Group:
A pair of WWII vintage aircaft carriers a few kilometers apart. Carriers are wide enough to permit a pair of aircraft to takeoff from each carrier simultaneously. However, secondary crafts will need to be placed manually. Carrier flight decks are short and close to the surcafe of the ocean. Craft lacking short takeoff distances or fast climb rates are not recommended.
Runway Length: 260m
Takeoff orientation:
	A -->     <-- B
