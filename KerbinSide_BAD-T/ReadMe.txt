This pack comes with four premade arenas for 2v2 dogfights. Each arena features 4 runways, divided into A and B groups for easy setup of craft.

Boostershire farms: 
Small farm next to a river. Runways are closer together; attempting to do 2v2 with bomber-sized craft may result in runway collisions during takeoff.

takeoff orientation:
	A -->
	A -->
	<-- B
	<-- B

Messerkerman Aircraft Factory: 
Factory complex built adjacent to a scenic Alpine lake. Beautiful view. Short runway length mitigated by runway placement.

tankeoff orientation:
	A -->
	A -->
	<-- B
	<-- B

Pyramid Site:
An expeditionary airfield built in the shadow of the Pyramid deep in Kerbin's primary desert. Lots of sun, lots of sand. Sudden elevation changes break up the landscape; aircraft with good turn rate or higher min altitudes suggested.
Runway length: 825m
Takeoff orientation:
	A -->        <-- B
	A -->        <-- B    

Kenemunde Rocket Base:

This pack also comes with one premade arena for 1v1 or 2v2 dogfights. This arena features 2 runways, divided into A and B for easy setup of craft.

Crater Fleet Carrier Group:
A pair of WWII vintage aircaft carriers a few kilometers apart. Carriers are wide enough to permit a pair of aircraft to takeoff from each carrier simultaneously. However, secondary crafts will need to be placed manually. Carrier flight decks are short and close to the surface of the ocean. Craft lacking short takeoff distances or fast climb rates are not recommended.
Runway Length: 260m
Takeoff orientation:
	A -->     <-- B
	A -->     <-- B

Finally, this pack comes with one premade arena for up to 3v3 dogfights. This arena features 6 runways, divided into A and B for easy setup of craft

Oasis Proving Grounds
A dedicated combat arena situated around a desert oasis. Come for the fights, stay for the beach parties. Fighters can get pretty spread out, using the Wingman commands to keep them grouped may be required/needed.
